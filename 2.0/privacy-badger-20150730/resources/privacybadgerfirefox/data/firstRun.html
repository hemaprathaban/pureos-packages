      <p>Privacy Badger blocks spying ads and invisible trackers.  It's there to
      ensure that companies can't track your browsing without your consent.</p> 

      <p>This extension is designed to automatically protect your privacy from
      third party trackers that load invisibly when you browse the web. We
      send the Do Not Track header with each request, and our extension
      evaluates the likelihood that you are still being tracked. If the
      algorithm deems the likelihood is too high, we automatically block your
      request from being sent to the domain. Please understand that Privacy
      Badger is in beta, and the algorithm's determination is not conclusive
      that the domain is tracking you.</p>

      <p>Our extension has three states. <span
      style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Red</span> means Privacy Badger
      believes this domain is a tracker, and has blocked it. <span
      style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold;">Yellow</span> means the domain is
      believed to be both a tracker and necessary for the functioning of the
      page, so Privacy Badger is allowing it but blocking its cookies. <span
      style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Green</span> means that Privacy
      Badger believes this is not tracker. You can click on the Privacy Badger
      icon in your browser's toolbar if you wish to override the automatic
      blocking settings. Or, you can browse in peace as Privacy Badger starts
      finding and eating up web trackers one by one.</p>

      <p>Nothing can stop the Privacy Badger from eating cookies when it's
      hungry!</p>

      <p>Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
