pbuilder (0.207) unstable; urgency=low

  The default configuration will now only install trusted packages.  This
  prevents building packages with manipulated sources or a system compromise
  due to a man-in-the-middle attack.

  However this also prevents installing packages from unsigned repositories by
  default.

  If you really want to continue using unsigned repositories, you have to set
  ALLOWUNTRUSTED=yes in your .pbuilderrc or use the --allow-untrusted option.
  But if possible use a signed repository and set the used keys with the new
  --keyring option (can be passed multiple times).

  Due to this change the PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSOPT option --check-key is no
  longer necessary and thus deprecated.

  The default configuration will now enable ccache.  To disable installation
  and usage of ccache in pbuilder, unset CCACHEDIR in your pbuilderrc.

  --debbuildopts is now additive and will append to pbuilderrc's
  DEBBUILDOPTS.  To reset the list of options, pass --debbuildopts "".

  The default debootstrap command is now "debootstrap" instead of
  "cdebootstrap"; cdebootstrap is still supported, but you might have to set
  DEBOOTSTRAP="cdebootstrap" in your pbuilderrc or pass
  --debootstrap=cdebootstrap to use it.  Custom cdebootstrap options set via
  DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS or --debootstrapopts might not be compatible with
  debootstrap.

  The default PBUILDERROOTCMD is now "sudo -E" instead of "sudo"; this allows
  passing env vars for pbuilderrc expansion or to the build process such as
  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
