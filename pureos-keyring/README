README for the pureos-keyring package
=====================================

Introduction
------------

The PureOS project signs its Release files that are stored on the PureOS
archive and its mirrors with the keys contained in this package.

A quick overview about this package:

* Each actively used key is placed in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to be used by
  "apt" and its apt-key command. The signatures of acquired Release files
  are checked against this key database. It thus contains all keys of
  releases that are still supported and need to be active.
* /usr/share/keyrings/pureos-archive-keyring.gpg:
  A keyring including all actively used keys to sign Release files in our
  supported releases is shipped in /usr/share/keyrings.
* /usr/share/keyrings/pureos-archive-removed-keys.gpg:
  A keyring including all keys used by previous releases, which are no
  longer supported. These keys are no longer used to sign Release files.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
in the manpage apt-secure(8).
